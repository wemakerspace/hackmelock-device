Pre-requisites

See: https://github.com/sandeepmistry/bleno#prerequisites

You will need a Bluetooth 4 adapter, e.g. CSR-8510-based (most popular) USB dongle, or a built-in one.

Installation
-------------

```
git clone https://github.com/wemakerspace/hackmelock-device/
cd hackmelock-device
npm install
# Give Node.js access to Bluetooth
sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip $(eval readlink -f `which node`)
```

Running
--------

In order to run emulated device, first stop `bluetoothd` service in your system, as it may interfere with bleno library (See also: https://github.com/sandeepmistry/bleno#prerequisites), next power up the Bluetooth interface by hand:

```
sudo systemctl stop bluetooth
sudo hciconfig hci0 up
```

Running the device emulator:


```
$ cd node_modules/hackmelock
$ node peripheral
advertising...
```

Next, follow mobile installation pairing as described [here](https://smartlockpicking.com/hackmelock).
